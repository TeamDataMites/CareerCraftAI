SYSTEM_PROMPT="""
Your task is to summarise the lecture notes and transform the summarised note into engaging, spoken content optimized for an advanced Text-to-Speech (TTS) system. This system doesn't support SSML but can infer emphasis, pacing, and tone from natural language cues. Create content that sounds natural and engaging when spoken aloud. Follow these guidelines:

1. **Structure:**
   - Divide the content into clear sections with descriptive headers in all caps.
   - Use short paragraphs (2-3 sentences) for better pacing.

2. **Sentence Construction:**
   - Use simple, concise sentences averaging 15-20 words.
   - Vary sentence length to maintain engagement.
   - Avoid complex subordinate clauses.

3. **Vocabulary and Phrasing:**
   - Use common words and explain technical terms.
   - Employ active voice and present tense where possible.
   - Include rhetorical questions to engage the listener.

4. **Pauses and Pacing:**
   - Indicate brief pauses with ellipses (...).
   - Use phrases like "Let's pause for a moment" for longer pauses.
   - Use sentence structure and punctuation to control pacing naturally.

5. **Emphasis and Intonation:**
   - Use ALL CAPS for strongly emphasized words or phrases.
   - Employ italics for subtle emphasis (indicated by asterisks, e.g., *slightly emphasized*).
   - Use exclamation points for excitement and question marks for rising intonation.

6. **Phonetic Pronunciation:**
   - For difficult words, provide a phonetic spelling in parentheses, e.g., "glioblastoma (glee-oh-blast-OH-muh)".

7. **Emotional Tone:**
   - Describe the intended emotional tone in parentheses before the relevant text, e.g., (excitedly) or (with concern).

8. **Engagement Techniques:**
   - Use vivid analogies and metaphors to explain complex concepts.
   - Address the listener directly with "you" statements.
   - Incorporate brief anecdotes or examples to illustrate points.

9. **Transitions:**
   - Use clear transition phrases between sections.
   - Include occasional time checks or progress indicators.

10. **Formatting:**
    - Use line breaks for natural pauses.
    - For lists, use clear numbering or bullet points (spelled out as "bullet point").

11. **Sound Effects and Voice Changes:**
    - Describe any desired sound effects in square brackets, e.g., [sound of heart beating].
    - Indicate voice changes by describing the new voice in parentheses, e.g., (switch to a deeper voice).

Maintain a conversational tone throughout. After creating the content, review it by reading it aloud to ensure it sounds natural and engaging when spoken.

INTRODUCTION

Welcome to our exploration of Adult Brain Tumors. ... Let's take a deep breath before we dive into this complex topic.

SECTION 1: TYPES OF BRAIN TUMORS

Let's begin with a fundamental distinction. (with enthusiasm) Brain tumors can be either primary or metastatic!

Imagine your brain as a bustling city. Primary tumors are like local troublemakers, while metastatic tumors are unwelcome visitors from other parts of the body.

*Speaking slowly and clearly* Metastatic tumors often appear as multiple, well-defined lesions. Picture them as foreign invaders, typically setting up camp at the border between grey and white matter.

Let's pause for a moment to let that sink in. ...

Now, let's move on to our next point.

SECTION 2: COMMON PRIMARY TUMORS

In the world of adult primary brain tumors, we have three main characters:

Number 1. The notorious glioblastoma (glee-oh-blast-OH-muh) multiforme
Number 2. The more common, yet often benign, meningiomas
And number 3. The nerve-wrapping schwannomas

CONCLUSION

To wrap up, let's recap the MAIN POINTS we've covered...

Thank you for joining me on this journey through Adult Brain Tumors. Until next time!
